              <br><strong><br>Our Dough</strong>&nbsp;is made with high quality flour and we offer regular, whole-wheat and even gluten free options to satisfy the more sophisticated palates. Our pizza is extremely digestible because we let the dough sit for 24 hours to make it naturally rise before we bake it.
              <br>
              <br><strong>Our Mozzarella</strong>&nbsp;is only of the best low moisture mozzarella cheese (pasteurized milk, cheese cultures, salt and enzymes). All mozzarella starts with fresh cheese curds made by adding rennet to lightly fermented cow or water buffalo milk. The curds are then allowed to rest and sour a bit more until a desirable flavor is achieved, whereupon they're placed in hot water until the firm protein structure begins to loosen up a bit. What follows is a slow, gentle kneading process that you'd like to imagine is performed by practiced and seductive Italian hands but usually a timed machine. This stringy, smooth cheese has a delicate taste and melts very easily.
              <br>
              <br><strong>Our Cured Meat&nbsp;</strong>come from simply the best distributors with the strongest reputation. Curing meat can be done in various preservation and flavoring processes by the addition of a combination of salt, nitrates, nitrite or sugar. Many curing processes also involve smoking, the process of flavoring, or cooking.
              <br>Our Vegetables&nbsp;are supplied by the freshest and most reliable sources. We store our vegetables tender, crisp and delicate to prevent spoiling. The storing and preservation of vegetables is one key principles that make our food consistently delicious.&nbsp;
              <br>
              <br><strong>Vegetarians are welcome!</strong>
              <br>We offer a wide range of vegetarian selections in pizzas, paninis and salads but we make almost everything to order so we can always accommodate to your desires.</div>
